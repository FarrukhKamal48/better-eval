# A Math Expression Parser

Evaluates math expressions with support for `functions` and `variables`.

# Building

Only built/tested on Linux.

```
run `make`
execulabe path is `build/Eval`
```

# Running

If ran without arguments, it will prompt for math expressions (repeatedly untill you type `\q` for quit). While in this prompt, type `\h` for help.

You can also run it by providing a math expression:
`build/Eval "<math-expression>"`
